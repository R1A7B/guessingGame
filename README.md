# guessingGame
I created a simple C++ program where you give a txt file containing various numbers on different lines, and it will select a random number from that file. Then, it will prompt you to guess for that number until you correctly guess it.

To run this file, open up terminal/command prompt/whatever command line or linux subsystem you use, select the folder where you have placed both the txt files and the output files. For example, if you placed all 3 in your desktop, it might look c/Users/yourname/OneDrive/Desktop. Then, type "./ggMain.out 1000_5_digit_numbers.txt" to run the program using my 1000_5_digit numbers file.
